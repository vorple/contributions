WINDOWS
-------

- Download and unzip http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.10.3.zip
- Inside the zip is a folder called "html". Put the whole Inform 7 project and its materials folder there directly under the html folder (so you'll have e.g. html/Project Name.inform and html/Project Name.materials folders).
- Run nginx.exe which is also inside the zip. Nothing visible happens, but it starts the local server. You can confirm by opening http://localhost on a browser which should show a welcome message. (The welcome message says that further configuration is needed but that's not true.) It'll keep running until you reboot the computer.
- Build the I7 project by clicking Release. Don't click on the "Browse" buttons that Inform offers, they won't work.
- Open a browser, go to http://localhost/Project Name.materials/Release/play.html but replace "Project Name.materials" with the actual name of the materials folder.


macOS
-----

- Open Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)
- Go to the Inform project's materials folder (type "cd " without quotes, including the space, and drag the materials folder from Finder to the Terminal window to get the full path, then press enter)
- Type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" without quotes
- Release the project in Inform, open browser, go to http://localhost:8000/Release/play.html


Linux
-----

Same as macOS. If you get "command not found" you need to install Python 2 with the Linux distribution's package manager.


actually if you have python 3, it's "python3 -m http.server"
